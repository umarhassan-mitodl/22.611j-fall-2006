  two fluid equations, two fluid equilibrium: diamagnetic current, reduction of fluid
  approach to the single fluid equations, MHD equilibria, toroidal equilibrium, plasma
  dynamics (MHD), flux conservation, field line motion, MHD stability, general perturbations
  of cylindrical equil, general principles governing instabilities, and a quick and
  simple analysis of pinches.'
